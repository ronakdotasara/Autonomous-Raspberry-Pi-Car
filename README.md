# Autonomous-Raspberry-Pi-Car
This AI-powered Raspberry Pi 4 car is designed for lane following, traffic light detection, obstacle avoidance, and adaptive cruise control. Using OpenCV, YOLOv4, and OCR, it processes real-time camera input to make driving decisions. The system ensures smooth navigation by dynamically adjusting speed and stopping for traffic signals and obstacles.
